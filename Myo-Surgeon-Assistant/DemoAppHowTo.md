##Step 3 - Train your Myo
First charge the Myo.
Next plugin the Bluetooth usb hub.  
Then run the "Training" program.
Please Note - the light on the Myo will turn blue if connected.  If you do not get a blue light trying running the "hello-myo" and "myo-id" in the "bin" folder.  The "bin" folder can be fund in the Myo SDK Alpha 6 zip.

RUNNING THE APP
Once you have completed the steps above, below is how the app works:

Gestures:
Fist - this will make the Myo Buzz.  While holding the Fist gesture, move your arm around to nav around the skeleton.  
Wave in - Rotates the skeleton to the left
Wave out - Rotates the skeleton to the right
Finger Spread - Resets the screen target and centers the myo to the screen
Twist In - This is your "mouse click". Placing the target over a hotspot and doing the "Twist In" gesture will be the click for at hotspot.

Hotspots in the Scene:
Red Orb on Rt Knee on Skeleton - twist in to turn x-ray thumb nails on and off
Each x-Ray Thumbnail - twist in will make the x-ray zoom larger and to the left of the screen
Selected Zoom-In x-Ray - twist in will return the x-ray image to is thumb-nail position
Stop Watch Icon - twist in will open the 5, 10, 15 time left option.  twist in again will close the 5, 10, 15 icons
5, 10, 15 Icons - twist in will send the events to Salesforce, show a 2sec UI message, then close automatically
x-Ray Icon - twist in will open the YES and NO buttons and title quesiton for pos-op x-Ray option.  twist in again will close the YES and NO buttons and title quesiton for pos-op x-Ray
NO Button - twist in will close the YES and NO buttons and title quesiton for pos-op x-Ray
YES Button - twist in will send the specific Salesforce events and show a 2sec UI Message, then close automatically
Step 1. - Open the "Myo_Surgeon_Assistant"
Step 2. - Give the app about 10sec to load.  (you will know this has been completed when the thumb-nail xray images disappear)
Step 3. - Center the Myo and screen target by using the "Finger Spread" gesture.  (note that if you lose or become off center with the myo and your arm movement use the "Finger Spread" gesture to re-center)
Step 4. - Review x-Ray images
Step 5. - Order Post-Op x-Ray (from the x-Ray icon)
Step 6. - Chose a "time left" (from the stop watch icon)

BUGS:
There are two current bugs:
If the skeleton flies away from the scene the first time you make a "fist" gesture, restart the app.
If one of the five x-Rays does not load (this will be noted with a large red x in place of the x-Ray image), restart the app.
